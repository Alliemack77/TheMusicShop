## The Music Shop

This project is built with:

- HTML
- Sass
- Parcel
- Font Awesome
- Netlify

I created this project to challenge how quickly I could design, build and deploy a webpage. The concept was a landing page promoting online performances for a recording studio in downtown Nashville. This project took 10 days to complete and looking back I can spot some design flaws, but overall I think I was able to capture the spirit of this fictional hotspot.
